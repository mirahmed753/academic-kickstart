I'm Mir, an aspiring Software Developer. I'm currently a Computer Science & Mathematics senior at the University of Florida.

This summer, I created an API for real-time streaming data at Capital One. Last summer, I worked on the open source project CraneLift at Mozilla.

Feel free to connect with me on social media!
